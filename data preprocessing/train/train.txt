When I left office, I told you all that the single most important thing I could do would be to help prepare the next generation of leaders to take their own crack at changing the world.

"Our goal wasn't just to make sure more people have coverage‚Äîit was to make sure more people have better coverage." ‚ÄîPresident Obama	You need to realize that life's too short to cry over people that aren't crying over you. So smile and know you have people that love you.
Today marks a crucial step forward in the fight against climate change, as the historic Paris Climate Agreement officially enters into force. Let's keep pushing for progress.	Please establish a Special Prosecutor to investigate who and what was behind FBI Director James Comey's illegal interference into the Presidential election 11 days before the vote was held.
The economic progress we're making is undeniable‚Äîand it's up to all of us to keep building an economy that works for all Americans.	this was only done by the actions of Trump.not by Obama.Obama is selling us out while Trump is keeping jobs in America.doesn't take a genius to see the truth.
Obamacare was designed on the principle that health care coverage that's affordable, accessible to all, and free from discrimination should be a right, not a privilege. We can't afford to let opponents roll that back.	Keep Obamacare, and regulate the insurance companies. It's bad enough to have a "pre-existing condition," let alone, not being able to pay for it.
Millions of Americans are benefiting from Obamacare.	Which means, of course, that the insurance rates of others are lower...it isn't perfect, but at least people can consider getting healthcare.
Gracias al Obamacare, es m√°s f√°cil mantenerse sano con cuidado preventivo.	Gracias se√±or presidente por ser muy humilde q Dios lo guarde y q siempre tenga esa humildad usted es un gran presidente no como el rasista de trump filiz miercoles

Don't be spooked by the headlines‚Äîwith financial assistance, most people can find coverage for $75 or less. The health care marketplace opens back up tomorrow.	Great...because the whole world should be on financial assistance. Everything will work out fine when people can no longer afford to buy the things they need  by themselves anymore.

The Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans gain the security and peace of mind that comes with being covered.	All because of you Mr,President people should be greatful instead of puting it down and its the republicans and trust me they use it.
Team Obamacare is making sure millions of Americans stay informed and get covered.	Well that sure was a failure, and cost oh so much.If you want govt run healthcare move to Europe where people die waiting for proper care.Suckers!
Senate leaders continue to stand in the way of a fair Supreme Court nomination process. They need to fulfill their responsibility to the Court and the American people.	If Senate leaders continue to fail to do their jobs, arrest them and put them on trial and impeach them for failure to perform the duties of their office.
2016 has been a big year for global efforts in the fight against climate change.	Practice what you preach...The tpp will put the fight for the environment at a huge disadvantage.

The record-breaking heat we've been seeing year after year is contributing to the number of fires that break out, the acreage that burns, and the duration of the season.	biggest threat is that the Forestry Dept. is not allowed to do controlled burns for over 40 years and the over growth accumulated.
We're seeing big progress in the fight against climate change‚Äîbut we can't slow down the push for action now.	Quite OK & fundamental on the fight against climate change, let hope is not an economic conspiracy just as its may look.
Countries across the globe have united in a groundbreaking agreement to fight climate change‚Äîthat's what meaningful progress looks like.	Mr presidant obama we cant late in offer truth soultion to climate change majoar countries main players in pouplation

How can some be so backward and one family be so positive you should lead for eternity President Obama. There just are not enough ways to say Thanks
Another day has gone by without the hearing Judge Garland deserves. Senate leaders' refusal to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is unacceptable.	26 days from now the lame duck congress may move very quickly to a hearing but the name may be withdrawn.
Senate leaders continue to stand in the way of a fair Supreme Court nomination process. They need to fulfill their responsibility to the Court and the American people.	They just fulfill their responsibility by standing in the way of the process. Instead of posting non-sense, continue to demonstrate your stand are right.
"You know, I think that change happens typically not because somebody on high decides it‚Äôs going to happen, but rather because at a grassroots level enough people come together that they force the system to change." ‚ÄîPresident ObamaWatch the President speak at a town hall at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro. http://ofa.bo/2dcZtW5	That's what is happening in the Philippines, grassroots came together because they want the system to change!

No American family should be trapped by high-cost loans that they can't escape.That's why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is working on tough rules to rein in payday lenders' predatory practices‚Äîand they're taking public comments through the end of the day today.	the politic can not be the economic to college money but the country must make a best law for people need who follow from their good support.

This is our best possible shot to save the planet from the devastating effects of climate change.	Now let's save America from the Devastating effects of the Obama Presidency....
By blocking a Supreme Court nominee, Senate obstructionists have indefinitely delayed critical decisions that affect millions of Americans. Senate leaders need to stop treating the vacancy like a game. http://ofa.bo/2du4cWe	They need to stop treating the entire United States government as a game.
We've got to make sure that our economy works for everyone.

"Paid sick leave isn‚Äôt a side issue, or a women‚Äôs issue, or something that‚Äôs just nice to have.It‚Äôs a must-have.By the way, so are economic priorities like child care, paid family leave, equal pay, and a higher minimum wage.We need a Congress that will act on all these issues." ‚ÄîPresident Obama	Sometimes it is a matter that you can pay your bills that week and put food on the table. Workers don't get to take time off from their responsibilities.
This is crucial progress in the push for better workplace policies.	Well. In the UK, the Tory-right wing-government is pushing for worse workplace policies.
This is not how to treat your country with respect. http://ofa.bo/2d1UbNK	You have no right to speak of how to treat a country with respect
The United States is the only developed country that doesn‚Äôt have a national paid sick leave requirement. President Obama is trying to change that.	The only way for Americans to get national paid sick leave, is to elect a Democratic House and Senate that will work with President Clinton.
Judge Garland has had overwhelming bipartisan support in the past‚Äîeven from senators who are currently obstructing his confirmation.	Judge Garland shouldn't have had to be humiliated by the representatives of Congress and the Senate!
This is good news. We've got to keep building on this progress to make sure our economy works for everyone‚Äînot just those at the top.	Here, here Mr. President!...America will be sorry to see you go after they quickly see what our future holds with the next Presidency and its cabinet!
Our economy is getting stronger, with a growing middle class and a shrinking number of Americans now living below the poverty line.	.president Liar, the middle class is shrinking, the poor is poorer and more people are Unemployed and on gov't assistant under your reign of terror.

According to a new report, climate change is likely to pose a threat to national security‚Äîwe can't afford to deny it.	Hillary Clinton also will likely pose a threat to national security and you say we should vote for her? We can't afford to deny that.
The work we do to fight climate change is more important and urgent than ever.	great graphic to demonstrate why we need to act now on climate change. (couldn't have said it better myself) Thanks.
"Such a lengthy period of record-setting warmth is unprecedented in 137 years of temperature observation."	Pretty sure the average eath temperature was warmer than this before the last ice age that we are still recovering from?
It's been more than six months, and Senate leaders are still refusing to give Judge Garland a fair hearing. This obstruction is unprecedented, and it needs to end.	I'm FED UP with all thisüí©üí©üí©üí©!!! We as a country need to get it together or else...üò°üò°üò°üò°
Judge Garland received the American Bar Association's highest possible rating. Senate leaders should at least give him a fair hearing.	I'm just glad that Grassley had time to climb to the top of a windmill, but not take the time to honor hearings for this fine gentleman.....
In the words of a champion for climate action: "We are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last generation that can do something about it." What kind of future we leave for our children depends on the work we do today.	It also depends on how well we educate our children. Teach them while they're young enough to be fearful of the implications, but old enough to understand the urgency.
The Supreme Court still has a vacant seat.President Obama's nominee is still waiting for a hearing.	I am still waiting for a decent job. But, I've been waiting since 1980.
American leadership on the global stage has helped create progress like the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal. http://ofa.bo/2cO62BY	President sir,u the best ,and one of the strong leaders in the world ,u have raised so many issues like global warming ,terririsom on global platform,thank u so much sir
The Senate leadership's partisan obstruction has gone too far. Six months of refusing to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is unacceptable.	Ummm....seems JN and AS aren't aware of the fact that giving a hearing is part of the job those folks in congress were hired to do......?
For half a year, Senate leaders have refused to hold a hearing on one of the most qualified Supreme Court nominees in history. They're putting politics first.	Shame on the Republican senators who are doing politics on the appointment of a Supreme Court.
President Obama continues his work on conservation, protecting nearly 5,000 square miles off the coast of New England.	Now Obama moved the Marine Memorial to off shore in New England!?  Does Arlington know about this!!.
"There should not be an empty seat on the bench when the Supreme Court convenes on the first Monday in October."Senator Leahy calls on his colleagues to correct the course of their unprecedented obstruction and consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court.	Truth be told Americans would rather have an empty seat than have a full bench that supports the previous decision on Citizens United.  Legalized corruption was the result.
We have to keep building on the progress we've made in tackling climate change.	Vote blue, to have any chance of addressing the climate change issue in our lifetime.
America does best when the economy grows from the middle out.	Good joke.  All the new income goes to the top 1%, but sure, lets just call that middle-out growth.  Let's bail out the middle class next time.
A declining poverty rate and a stronger middle class‚Äîthat's how to build a stronger America.	A declining poverty rate and a stronger middle class. Not where I live.
Solar power continues to gain traction across the country. Read how this important industry is growing.	Great mr president with the advance technology of digolised word it is with great advantage to most rural areas where electricity is in adequate i ilike it.
We have to keep building on the progress we've made in tackling climate change.	More dramatically than the  national economic problems were facing, which are incidently due in part to government regulations which are supposed to slow climate change?  Highly improbable.
There's still time to give Judge Garland a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote, Senate leaders.	Scalia didn't get a fair anything when he was murdered to further your agenda on gun control, you are a laugh!
A helpful guide.	Yes because Obama can give a helpful guide haha! Thanks for the comedic value!
The Paris Climate Agreement is now a step closer to going into effect. But we can't stop there.	You know what's terrifying?The President I love isn't putting a stop to the Dakota Pipeline.Shameful what's going on there.
Thanks to Obamacare, millions of Americans have gained quality, affordable health care‚Äîand the uninsured rate has now dropped to a historic low. http://ofa.bo/2bW7qOO	When people are forced to be insured of course the uninsured rate would be dropped.

By formally joining the Paris Climate Agreement, we send a message to the rest of the world: We are ready to act on climate.	It about time! How long will it take for the conservatives to join the 21st century?
Senate leaders are back from recess now, and they have the opportunity to get important work done‚Äîlike giving Judge Garland a hearing.	The only work that any of them are going to do is in getting themselves reelected. Remove , Reject and Replace , send them home
"Healthy and diverse lands and waters help us build resilience to climate change." ‚ÄîPresident Obama	it's good to save the marine conservation and help resolving inside habitats
"When workers raise their voices for a fair wage and dignity in the workplace, they sustain the story of America: the idea that if you work hard, you should be able to get ahead, retire with dignity, and leave something behind for the next generation." ‚ÄîPresident ObamaCheck out President Obama's open letter to American workers on Labor Day: http://ofa.bo/2bO7eRK	In this country Nigeria if workers raised their vioce for better pay they get a squar militry order to get back to work or face sack.

Their efforts are why we can depend on health insurance, Social Security, Medicare, and retirement plans." ‚ÄîPresident Obama.Watch the weekly address.	Hey Barack, Why are you not paying attention to the Dakota Pipeline Protest!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Do you do and say nothing when the lives of American people are threatened by greed?
It's time to put politics aside and get to work.	Why don't you set an example and put politics aside and so the Senate can get back to work?
Over the last eight years, we have built a stronger economy that works better for the American people.	America has built a stronger economy indeed....Without President Obama,America economy wouldn't have been as strong as it is today.....Thanks to President Barack Obama!.....Like,if you believe this!!
The Constitution is the law of the land. Senate leaders should not ignore it.	Indeed the constitution is the suprime law of the land and all should follow it accordingly.
The Senate returns from recess next week. Filling the Supreme Court vacancy should be at the top of their to-do list.	Actually figuring out what the hell you did with the $6.5 trillion that is missing should be at the top of the list

Global temperatures are steadily rising with no signs of slowing down. Denying climate change is dangerous.	That record will be broken next year. But it is not Global warming of Climate change. It's naturally increasing temperatures that will increase every year for no apparent reason.

Congress needs to stand up to the gun lobby and vote on common-sense legislation‚Äîfor the victims of gun violence, for their families, and for all our communities. http://ofa.bo/2b1N3jf	Our voices apparently don't matter. Only the gun lobby matters. And you people need to show some respect for our President.
Ignoring America's gun violence epidemic is unacceptable. We must keep the pressure on congressional leaders to do something.	Or we could all be like you Obama and send untraceable military grade hardware to Mexican drug cartels to spur on the violence  (fast and furious gun scandal)
It's been more than 150 days since President Obama nominated Judge Garland.Senate leaders: Do your jobs.	It's been like 6 years since ISIS has been killing people, do your job.
For a record-breaking 153 days, Senate obstructionists have refused to hold a hearing for one of the most well qualified Supreme Court nominees in U.S. history. That's unacceptable.	It goes against convention to confirm a Supreme Court nomination in an election year. It isn't one rule for Obama and another for other presidents.
Protecting access to affordable health care, economic opportunity, and equal pay for women makes a difference for everyone.	Equal pay for equal work is a fundamental right of the Indian Constitution.
Gender equality in the 21st century has come a long way, but there's still work to be done.	Note this universal truth that World's time going to finish  have so many symdom -one of that is women's become more and more powerful work in outside*.
"There‚Äôs still much more to do.But there‚Äôs no doubt that America has become a global leader in the fight against climate change.Last year, that leadership helped us bring nearly 200 nations together in Paris around the most ambitious agreement in history to save the one planet we‚Äôve got.	I hope this will reverse the damage that all those years of America being the global leader in polluting the Earth has done.

Improving energy efficiency saves American families money and fights climate change‚Äîand President Obama has made it a priority.	That's great President about energy saving as well as to fight against global warming and climate change and protect our planet.....
Senate leaders aren't taking their responsibility seriously enough. The Supreme Court needs nine justices.	no they are taking things seriously and questioning you for a change, something they should have done to begin with and stopped a lot of your mess,

Fourteen presidents have appointed 21 Supreme Court justices during an election year. The Senate has no excuse not to act. http://ofa.bo/d5gn	Another way to word this is, "Two-thirds of all U.S. presidents never appointed a Supreme Court justice in an election year."

Victoria, a summer organizer in DC, explains why you or someone you know should apply for our Fall Fellowship Program: ‚ÄúYou will learn so much about yourself and your capacity to be committed to a cause.The Obama campaign is only as great as its organizers."	No, Victoria, the Obama campaign is only as good as Pres. Obama himself, but thank you for your perceived commitment to our country.
Quote of the day: "The American people may have voted for divided government, but they didn't vote for a dysfunctional government.If you want a balanced approach to reducing the deficit, let your member of Congress know.If you believe we can solvethis problem through compromise, send that message." ‚Äì President Obama	The way the senate is acting is childish! If they can't do the job, they need to be sent to bed(home) without their dinner(pay)!
President Obama addressed the National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights organization, this morning. He reiterated his vision for comprehensive immigration reform that will that allow us to remain true to our values as a nation of immigrants and meet our economic and security needs.	Give an immigration reform to the students and the hard working people that want a better life that have no criminal records.
You‚Äôve heard about our summer organizers‚Äîamazing volunteer organizers who have stepped up to be the next generation of leaders in this movement.Now we‚Äôre recruiting fall fellows to pick up their work and carry it forward in the months to come.Will you apply, or pass this opportunity along to a friend who might be interested?	I will help again with the campaign after I know that my President isn't giving away the farm to republicans to get a debt deal.
Emily F., a volunteer in Iowa, on why she's in: "This is really the people's campaign. Everyone has a fair shake and opportunity to shape this campaign. I cannot imagine not being a part of this."	Ditto! I cannot imagine not being a part of this.
Now, the fight for equal rights moves on. Here's the next front: repealing the so-called Defense of Marriage Act. http://OFA.BO/TvpzmS	But women still would be in the back of the pass. . .heavy sigh.
Yesterday the President certified the repeal of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell." Gays and lesbians will serve their country openly in 60 days.	so, it's ok to be openly gay in the military now?  DADT was put in place to protect gays in the military from discharge.
Today is the one-year anniversary of Wall Street reform. We made a video to give a quick overview of the law, and how it‚Äôs already working for you‚Äîwatch it now, then pass it along.	Obama is a joke. He needs to just gert out of this country right now,step down and resign.
At 5:57 a.m. E.T. this morning, the space shuttle Atlantis touched down, marking the end of the era of American space flight. During their flight, the President spoke with Commander Ferguson and the crew of the mission.	Isn't this the end of a chapter in American spaceflight and not the end of the era of American space flight.
Thanks to everyone who helped make our national Day of Action this past weekend such a big success. Volunteers attended more than 1,100 events across the country, bringing tens of thousands of new supporters into this campaign. That‚Äôs a great start‚Äîbut now we need your help with our next big organizing push on August 3rd.	yes of course, all people in all the word look fowards Obama to hope in the better future , it' s very important
‚ÄúWhen I was knocking on people's doors during the 2008 campaign, it felt like such a gift to be able meet my neighbors, those who live close to me, and those who live further away and lead very different lives. Seeing a snapshot into their lives, and sharing a part of mine, made me feel connected to a larger fabric of America.‚Äù Lisa, a business owner, talks about this movement's impact on her life.	And we the Africans view it as a great achievement & a new way one can reach the electorates to have his manifestors presented. Keep it up mr. President
Alex, a summer organizer in Nevada, spent a day last week talking to folks outside the DMV in his community. Hear why he calls the DMV the Department of Meeting Voters.	He is talking to much today his third post in couple of hours may got frightned in dream last night
The Obama family watching the World Cup women's soccer game. Go Team USA!	our family is watching too!
As we get fired up for the Women's World Cup, we spoke to Katie and Jessica‚Äîtwo soccer fans and Obama 2012 supporters who will be cheering on the team today.	Should be required viewing for republicans - see what can be achieved when you work hard, play fair and work for the goals of the team rather against it.
Back in March, President Obama spoke to a group of students in Massachusetts of all political persuasions about the role of compromise in a democracy. "The nature of our democracy and the nature of our politics is to marry principle to a political process that means you don't get 100% of what you want," the President said.	Compromise is indeed the base of education, as education evolves, so does compromise... This is my interpretation of the presidents mind set listening to His Holiness Dalai Lama
Tomorrow, the U.S. women's national soccer team will play in the FIFA World Cup championship match for the first time since 1999. Wish Team USA good luck by leaving a comment on this photo!	Best of luck to the USA women's national soccer team team USA is always the best
"By all pulling together however we can, we're supporting progress and helping President Obama continue his service to our country." Dave, a long-time Obama supporter, tells us why he's one of the more than 552,000 people who have already invested in the 2012 campaign.	you should profile some of the people who helped your campaign in 08....I would love to see how well you have served them...
Hundreds of thousands of supporters helped raise more than $86 million in this campaign's first three months.That's an important number‚Äîbut the number we care about most is the number of people like you who have stepped up to be a part of this campaign from the very beginning.http://OFA.BO/2Ei7Cw	I have a problem with the idea there are that many "little people" who contributed that amount in time or money rather than donate it to the local food banks..
Obama 2012 supporters made 680,000 contributions to this campaign in its first three months. And here's something we're pretty incredibly proud of: 98% of all the contributions people sent in were $250 or less. http://OFA.BO/caeoeC	We may be small, but together we can make a huge difference.  Unless of course there was some rule allowing for unlimited corporate campaign contributions ....
Over the last three months, organizers and volunteers have reached out to reconnect with more than 290,000 supporters in all 50 states. Nearly 31,000 of these were one-on-one, face-to-face conversations. http://OFA.BO/xbh1ZA	"Nearly 31,000 of these were one-on-one, face-to-face conversations."  Really? don't they have anything else to do this summer than waste their time?
We're filing this campaign's first financial report with the Federal Election Commission on Friday. But because you own this campaign, you deserve to hear the news first. Jim Messina has recorded a video briefing to share what we've raised, how we're spending it, and what's next.	Videos are great, but could you post a summary in the comments for those without an appropriate place to watch the video?
‚ÄúFor me it‚Äôs really simple: it‚Äôs a cause I believe in. And I like the T-shirts.‚Äù Erin, a mom of two in Oregon, tells us why she decided to become one of the hundreds of thousands of people to invest in this campaign from the very beginning.	It makes me warm inside to see that most people who hate Obama have the grammar of a third grader, and therefore will probably miss the polls yet again.
Have you accepted our challenge yet to bring 50 new people into this campaign for President Obama's 50th? Doing real organizing to get folks involved is the single best way to support this campaign.	It's getting harder to defend you among my friends, Mr. President. 50 is a big goal to ask for given what's been happening lately.
"We‚Äôre going to resolve this, and we‚Äôre going to resolve this for a reasonable period of time, and we‚Äôre going to resolve it in a serious way," the President said in a news conference on debt negotiations yesterday.	I cannot, in good conscience, support someone who advocates cutting Social Security and Medicare in order to make a deal with the devil.
We've been asking a lot of you‚Äîand in the first major test of this campaign, you delivered.Thank you.As a reminder of why we're working so hard to get the President re-elected, take a look at a short video from earlier this week.	Mr. President, We've been asking a lot of the democratic congress, party, and administration...no one has delivered. Would a second term accomplish anymore than this 1st one?
Today marks the 40th anniversary of the 26th Amendment ‚Äì which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, empowering young people to get more involved in the political process.	And thanks to the 26th Amendment I was part of the first group of 18 year olds to vote in the 1972 election for president of the USA.
It's a big moment: 475,000 donors now own a piece of this campaign. Thank you, everyone. http://OFA.BO/gPr8ve	You own a piece of the corruptionCongratulations to the sheeple

The First Lady is in Africa this week. ‚ÄúI think the most moving part of my trip so far was seeing 92-year-old Nelson Mandela, and just thinking about his life," she says. "This man has lived through a struggle that few nations have known.‚Äù	I think the picture of Michelle Obama with Nelson Mandela was an inspiration.  Maybe a lot of you do not remember where their race was just a few generations ago.

Meet Alex: a father of four who's spending his summer learning how to be a community organizer. He says he hopes his organizing work will help teach his kids that if "they see something that needs changed, they know they can make a difference."	At the very least. It will teach him to be a Lying MF, like you.
Targeting waste and making government more efficient have been priorities for my administration since day one. But as we work to tackle the budget deficit, we need to step up our game.	You need to pay attention to exactly what your agencies are cutting. Some of it very important services for the disabled and conservation. 
Government is not‚Äîand should not be‚Äîthe main engine of job creation in this country. That‚Äôs the role of the private sector. But one thing government can do is partner with the private sector to make sure that every worker has the necessary skills for the jobs they‚Äôre applying for.	Partnering with the sector will just be another thing the government will control eventually. Put money into education then jobs will increase over a period of time
Listening attentively to the story of the movement.	a new member of the class of the summer organizer tells his story.let's hope for some good listening skills,the sight might be blurry.

New Wranglers on the production line at the Chrysler Supplier Park.	When is the tour at Springfield Mass for the people affected by the tornado?
The final product at the Chrysler Supplier Park.	Good one Obama , production should be at the same place where you have potential buyers good step

‚ÄúOur task has been to rebuild the future on a stronger foundation than we had before to make sure that you can see your incomes and your savings rise again.‚Äù	Yes.....I still remember what Mr. President said during his campaign "It's not going to be easy but we can make it no matter how high the mountain is"...
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt run for President to get into the auto business‚ÄîI‚Äôve got more than enough to do. I ran for President because too many Americans felt their dreams slipping away from them.‚Äù	Thank you Mr. President for pulling back the curtain to expose the Republicans for who they really are....so very proud of you...always.
Introducing President Obama at the Chrysler Supplier Park.	I wish the res would ce to southeastern Ohio at the Ohio university in athen Ohio . And get on view point. Call740-753-2154
‚ÄúI put my faith in the American worker. And I‚Äôll tell you what‚ÄîI‚Äôm going to do that every day of the week, because what you‚Äôve done vindicates my faith.‚Äù	MISTAKE!!!! Put your faith in God first because that worker can die at any time................we love you President!!!!
‚ÄúWe said that if everyone involved was willing to take the tough steps, then we‚Äôd invest in your future; that we‚Äôd have your back.‚Äù	Even if you do not have born in  US, but if you're helping America grow, you're an American.  http://youtu.be/tIekamBDiAw
Chrysler has repaid every dime and more of what it owes American taxpayers for their support during my presidency‚Äîand it repaid that money six years ahead of schedule.	What did we get in return? JOBS  Now, when will AIG and Bear/Sterns be paying back the money Bush lent them?
While there is more work to be done, we are starting to see stronger sales, additional shifts at plants, and signs of strength in the auto industry and our economy‚Äîa true testament to the resolve and determination of American workers across the nation.	Please place some emphasis on the fact that so many of our jobs we could have here are now being done in China and other low-wage, disregard for workers countries!
In a world where the prosperity of all nations is now inextricably linked, a new era of cooperation is required to ensure the growth and stability of the global economy.	NO, its not. There is not a new era of cooperation needed. You've got that backwar
The government's fleet of cars and trucks includes more than 600,000 vehicles, which means that we have the largest fleet in America. We will make sure 100 percent of the vehicles we buy are fuel-efficient or clean-energy by 2015.	Couldn't we reduce the amount of cars and trucks in America's fleet of vehicles. We could save so much money not operating them all.
We need to reward reforms in education that are driven not by Washington, but by principals and teachers and parents. That's how we'll make progress‚Äînot from the top down, but from the bottom up.	Sounds good, but in Florida our wonderful Government cut money for education.  When will we learn that education is more important than the way he is spending the money.
If we‚Äôre serious about meeting our energy challenge, we‚Äôre going to have to do more than drill. And that‚Äôs why the real solution is clean, homegrown energy.	I agree President Obama! We need to do this and do this now, and the fact that gas is $4 proves that we need to change to clean energies asap.
Clean energy jobs are the jobs of the future ‚Äî jobs that pay well right here in America.	I hope I find one of these jobs that pay well in America.
We added another 268,000 private sector jobs in April, at a time when our economy has been facing some serious headwinds. We are making progress, and that proves how resilient the American economy is‚Äîand how resilient the American worker is.	That's what needs to happen. Private sector businesses need to bring the jobs back from overseas. Then the economy can recover and the worker pride can be restored !!!!!
We are grateful for our wounded warriors, who represent the very best of America. In their fight to recover and in yesterday's ride, we see the values and virtues that make our country great.	And all the unknown warriors who struggle every day to maintain the commendable values of our society - and are sometimes injured  because of their actions!
The Democratic Party has elected Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC Chair. Congratulations, Congresswoman.	who cares?  not a single citizen of washington dc has a say in anything, thanks to republicans and democrats.  who cares?
Congratulations to the 2011 Commencement Challenge finalists: High Tech High International in San Diego, California; Booker T. Washington High School in Memphis, Tennessee; and Bridgeport High School in Bridgeport, Washington.	"High Tech High International in San Diego, California"
Yesterday, we remembered and honored two soldiers with the highest military decoration that our nation can bestow‚Äîthe Medal of Honor. In so doing we also honored their families, who remind us that it is our extraordinary military families who also bear the heavy burden of war.	Thnk ou for noticing or recognizing that we, the families are also a part of our soldiers being where they are.
Just as it would undermine our future to ignore our deficits, it would also undermine our future to ignore the promise of students‚Äîyoung people who come to school to get a degree in the hopes of living out a better life.	it would also undermine our nation's future (our world's future, for that matter) to keep cutting education budgets...

Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, we've made it easy to get that information online for the very first time in history.	I don't question your patriotism, but I would like for you to ensure that the soldiers get paid before you do.
Last night, leaders of both parties came together to avert a government shutdown, cut spending, and invest in our future. This is good news for the American people. It means that small businesses can get the loans they need, and hundreds of thousands of Americans will get their paychecks on time‚Äîincluding our brave men and women in uniform.	it is better than a shut down...but congress has not done well at all to earn their pay the last few years...most of them haven't anyway...some have.
Every American can be proud of the lives we‚Äôve saved in Libya and of the service of our men and women in uniform, who once again have stood up for our interests and our ideals.	we are very proud of our men and women and the military!and the rest of our Military HOME!!!!!!
A lot of people think health reform is just for the uninsured or for people who are sick. But one of the biggest proportions of people who are uninsured are young adults who are making the transition from college to a first job or graduate program. Now they can stay on their parents' insurance.	No one mentions that young adults who are on the insurance policies of parents who were forced into early retirement are NOT covered after they leave college or turn 19.
In an increasingly global economy, our partnership with Latin American nations is only going to become more vital. It¬πs a source of growth and prosperity‚Äînot just for the people of Latin America, but for the American people as well.	Jobs need to be strengthen here first for Americans...being partnership with Latin Americans only means that the Americans will hire them for dirt cheap and leave us Americans behind...
As we celebrate together, let us take a moment to appreciate all that Ireland has given to America‚Äîthe faith we keep, the family we hold close, the laughter and song and warmth we feel when surrounded by the ones we love.	Its a beautiful thing to celebrate the Irish culture and they have given to America
As parents and students, as teachers and members of the community, we can take steps to help prevent bullying and create a climate in our schools in which all of our children can feel safe‚Äîa climate in which they all can feel like they belong.	Also ... We must teach our children how to see themselves so that a bully's words and actions have the opposite effect!!!!!
Bullying isn't an issue that makes headlines every day, but it affects every single young person in our country. Putting a stop to bullying is a responsibility we all share.	Well NOT just for every YOUNG person but the way this country is going THE ADULTS dont seem to be placing a GOOD EXAMPLE themselves ;(
When we sacrifice our commitment to education, we‚Äôre sacrificing our future. And we can‚Äôt let that happen. Our kids deserve better. Our country deserves better.	we sacrifice our peace for your war...........
Getting our fiscal house in order can‚Äôt just be something we use as a cover to do away with things we dislike politically‚Äîand it can‚Äôt just be about how much we cut.It‚Äôs got to be about how we cut and how we invest.We‚Äôve got to be smart about it.	our cost of living should be lower to be able to work with what  we got since we can't get jobs, pay raise, and bring jobs back to america.
One of the great joys of being President is getting a chance to pay tribute to the artists and authors, the poets and performers, who have touched our hearts and opened our minds.	Yeah. I would love Mr. Stephen Harper and all the Canadian Governements to do the same and respect artists as well as you do, Mr. Obama.

As we prepare to write the next chapter of women's history, we must carry forward the work of the women who came before us and ensure our daughters have no limits on their dreams, no obstacles to their achievements, and no remaining ceilings to shatter.	Women need to overcome the obstacles that are set up, and just keep leading in their respective roles!!!!
Instead of cutting the investments in education and innovation we need to out-compete the rest of the world, we need a balanced approach to deficit reduction. We all need to be willing to sacrifice, but we can‚Äôt sacrifice our future.	Mr. Obama, we need and have to work  hard for the future of the democracy
The U.S. strongly supports the universal rights of the Libyan people. That includes the rights of peaceful assembly, free speech, and the ability of the Libyan people to determine their own destiny. These are human rights. They are not negotiable. And they cannot be denied through violence or suppression.	What about our own free liberty and freedom of speech. We should have the same rights too
