Colorado volunteers registered over 30 new voters in Larimer County this past Saturday afternoon. “It was great to see what a difference we could make in just one afternoon,” one summer organizer said.	I like how everyone is saying the 30 voters were illegally in this country like it was a fact...
Meet Alex: a father of four who's spending his summer learning how to be a community organizer. He says he hopes his organizing work will help teach his kids that if "they see something that needs changed, they know they can make a difference."	At the very least. It will teach him to be a Lying MF, like you.
Targeting waste and making government more efficient have been priorities for my administration since day one. But as we work to tackle the budget deficit, we need to step up our game.	You need to pay attention to exactly what your agencies are cutting. Some of it very important services for the disabled and conservation. 
Waiting for the new class of summer organizers to arrive.	All the best to the workers!  Hoping to hear an emphasis on the words, "Jobs, jobs, jobs..."
New Wranglers on the production line at the Chrysler Supplier Park.	When is the tour at Springfield Mass for the people affected by the tornado?
The final product at the Chrysler Supplier Park.	Good one Obama , production should be at the same place where you have potential buyers good step
Chrysler has repaid every dime and more of what it owes American taxpayers for their support during my presidency—and it repaid that money six years ahead of schedule.	What did we get in return? JOBS  Now, when will AIG and Bear/Sterns be paying back the money Bush lent them?
While there is more work to be done, we are starting to see stronger sales, additional shifts at plants, and signs of strength in the auto industry and our economy—a true testament to the resolve and determination of American workers across the nation.	Please place some emphasis on the fact that so many of our jobs we could have here are now being done in China and other low-wage, disregard for workers countries!
In a world where the prosperity of all nations is now inextricably linked, a new era of cooperation is required to ensure the growth and stability of the global economy.	NO, its not. There is not a new era of cooperation needed. You've got that backwar
The government's fleet of cars and trucks includes more than 600,000 vehicles, which means that we have the largest fleet in America. We will make sure 100 percent of the vehicles we buy are fuel-efficient or clean-energy by 2015.	Couldn't we reduce the amount of cars and trucks in America's fleet of vehicles. We could save so much money not operating them all.
If we’re serious about meeting our energy challenge, we’re going to have to do more than drill. And that’s why the real solution is clean, homegrown energy.	I agree President Obama! We need to do this and do this now, and the fact that gas is $4 proves that we need to change to clean energies asap.
Clean energy jobs are the jobs of the future — jobs that pay well right here in America.	I hope I find one of these jobs that pay well in America.
We added another 268,000 private sector jobs in April, at a time when our economy has been facing some serious headwinds. We are making progress, and that proves how resilient the American economy is—and how resilient the American worker is.	That's what needs to happen. Private sector businesses need to bring the jobs back from overseas. Then the economy can recover and the worker pride can be restored !!!!!
We are grateful for our wounded warriors, who represent the very best of America. In their fight to recover and in yesterday's ride, we see the values and virtues that make our country great.	And all the unknown warriors who struggle every day to maintain the commendable values of our society - and are sometimes injured  because of their actions!
The Democratic Party has elected Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC Chair. Congratulations, Congresswoman.	who cares?  not a single citizen of washington dc has a say in anything, thanks to republicans and democrats.  who cares?
Congratulations to the 2011 Commencement Challenge finalists: High Tech High International in San Diego, California; Booker T. Washington High School in Memphis, Tennessee; and Bridgeport High School in Bridgeport, Washington.	"High Tech High International in San Diego, California"
Yesterday, we remembered and honored two soldiers with the highest military decoration that our nation can bestow—the Medal of Honor. In so doing we also honored their families, who remind us that it is our extraordinary military families who also bear the heavy burden of war.	Thnk ou for noticing or recognizing that we, the families are also a part of our soldiers being where they are.
Just as it would undermine our future to ignore our deficits, it would also undermine our future to ignore the promise of students—young people who come to school to get a degree in the hopes of living out a better life.	it would also undermine our nation's future (our world's future, for that matter) to keep cutting education budgets...

Chicago campaign event, Navy Pier. April 14, 2011	Mr. Obama President of the EE.UU 2012
Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, we've made it easy to get that information online for the very first time in history.	I don't question your patriotism, but I would like for you to ensure that the soldiers get paid before you do.
Last night, leaders of both parties came together to avert a government shutdown, cut spending, and invest in our future. This is good news for the American people. It means that small businesses can get the loans they need, and hundreds of thousands of Americans will get their paychecks on time—including our brave men and women in uniform.	it is better than a shut down...but congress has not done well at all to earn their pay the last few years...most of them haven't anyway...some have.
Every American can be proud of the lives we’ve saved in Libya and of the service of our men and women in uniform, who once again have stood up for our interests and our ideals.	we are very proud of our men and women and the military!and the rest of our Military HOME!!!!!!
A lot of people think health reform is just for the uninsured or for people who are sick. But one of the biggest proportions of people who are uninsured are young adults who are making the transition from college to a first job or graduate program. Now they can stay on their parents' insurance.	No one mentions that young adults who are on the insurance policies of parents who were forced into early retirement are NOT covered after they leave college or turn 19.
As we celebrate together, let us take a moment to appreciate all that Ireland has given to America—the faith we keep, the family we hold close, the laughter and song and warmth we feel when surrounded by the ones we love.	Its a beautiful thing to celebrate the Irish culture and they have given to America
As parents and students, as teachers and members of the community, we can take steps to help prevent bullying and create a climate in our schools in which all of our children can feel safe—a climate in which they all can feel like they belong.	Also ... We must teach our children how to see themselves so that a bully's words and actions have the opposite effect!!!!!
Bullying isn't an issue that makes headlines every day, but it affects every single young person in our country. Putting a stop to bullying is a responsibility we all share.	Well NOT just for every YOUNG person but the way this country is going THE ADULTS dont seem to be placing a GOOD EXAMPLE themselves ;(
When we sacrifice our commitment to education, we’re sacrificing our future. And we can’t let that happen. Our kids deserve better. Our country deserves better.	we sacrifice our peace for your war...........
Getting our fiscal house in order can’t just be something we use as a cover to do away with things we dislike politically—and it can’t just be about how much we cut.It’s got to be about how we cut and how we invest.We’ve got to be smart about it.	our cost of living should be lower to be able to work with what  we got since we can't get jobs, pay raise, and bring jobs back to america.
One of the great joys of being President is getting a chance to pay tribute to the artists and authors, the poets and performers, who have touched our hearts and opened our minds.	Yeah. I would love Mr. Stephen Harper and all the Canadian Governements to do the same and respect artists as well as you do, Mr. Obama.

As we prepare to write the next chapter of women's history, we must carry forward the work of the women who came before us and ensure our daughters have no limits on their dreams, no obstacles to their achievements, and no remaining ceilings to shatter.	Women need to overcome the obstacles that are set up, and just keep leading in their respective roles!!!!
Instead of cutting the investments in education and innovation we need to out-compete the rest of the world, we need a balanced approach to deficit reduction. We all need to be willing to sacrifice, but we can’t sacrifice our future.	Mr. Obama, we need and have to work  hard for the future of the democracy
The U.S. strongly supports the universal rights of the Libyan people. That includes the rights of peaceful assembly, free speech, and the ability of the Libyan people to determine their own destiny. These are human rights. They are not negotiable. And they cannot be denied through violence or suppression.	What about our own free liberty and freedom of speech. We should have the same rights too

Working together to protect the environment we share, lifting up the best ideas wherever we find them, preserving the great outdoors for our children and for their children—that’s our responsibility.	Why not preserve this great country for our kids and  stop spending?
President Kennedy once said that a nation reveals itself not only by the men and women it produces but also by the men and women that it honors—the people that it remembers. When you look at the men and women who received the Medal of Freedom, it says something about who we are as a people.	I think also by the men and women it protects AND honours? As a blind person I think this is very important.
Within five years, we want to make it possible for businesses to put high-speed wireless services in reach of virtually every American.	Why will it take five years?  We have the technology, we need to connect our workforce to the job now, not five years in the future.
High-speed wireless service is how we’ll spark new innovation, new investment, and new jobs—and connect every corner of America to the digital age.	High speed wireless service means nothing with a bandwidth cap like the one recently put into place in Canada. Keep our internet affordable and unregulated!
Today belongs to the people of Egypt, who have made it clear that nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day. The American people are moved by these scenes in Cairo and across Egypt because of who we are as a people and the kind of world that we want our children to grow up in.	This is the kind og world we want our children to grow up in not much has change since the 60's We as Black people are still being mistreated.

Honoring those who’ve served is about more than the words we say on Veterans Day or Memorial Day. It’s about how we treat our veterans every single day of the year.	It's about time we take care of those who work so hard for our freedom, security, and peace of mind. My heart and prayers are with them all...always.
President Obama was honored to sign the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act to ensure that rescue and recovery workers and others suffering from health consequences related to the World Trade Center disaster have access to the medical monitoring and treatment they need.

We are not a nation that says, “Don’t ask, don’t tell.” We are a nation that says, “Out of many, we are one.” We are a nation that welcomes the service of every patriot.We are a nation that believes that all men and women are created equal.Those are the ideals that generations have fought for.

What all of us care about is growing the American economy and creating jobs for the American people.Taken as a whole, that’s what this middle-class tax-cut bill is going to do.It’s a good deal for the American people.It's progress.And that’s what we were sent here to achieve.	higher taxes for the rich, not LOWER ones, is the only way out of this mess. you know it. do it.
We need to make sure our kids have the energy and the capacity to go toe to toe with any of their peers, anywhere in the world. And we need to make sure they’re all reaching their potential. That’s what this bill—the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act—will accomplish.	If you focused on returning jobs to America - then all of the kids would afford to be able to bring their own healthy food.
This is a very proud holiday tradition—in snow or shine, in good times and in periods of hardship, folks have gathered to light our national tree.	i like the holiday tradition of a good old filibuster to set the president right and take the country back from the rich. Thank you BERNIE!!!!
More than 14,000 members of the military have been discharged so far as a result of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”	makes you wonder how many of our deceased american soldiers might have been saved if the policy had been repealed a looooong time ago.
Why is the DREAM Act so important for our country? Ask organizers, veterans, and business owners.	I guess it wasn't important enough for you to press for this in liu of giving the rich more tax cuts.  Such a disappointment you are Mr. President.

This administration is working to ensure that patients can receive compassionate care and equal treatment during their hospital stays.

Our nation is founded on the belief that all of us are equal and each of us deserves the freedom to pursue our own version of happiness. No one deserves to be bullied.	Nobodies equal. We are CREATED equal, with the equal oppurtunities of pursuing our own dreams. It's what we do with that oppurtunity that puts us above or below others. 
America cannot stand still in the face of challenge. We can't afford to put our future on hold. That's why a big part of the Recovery Act has been about investing in the future.	i believe the national health plan is a good thing.i also believe it will stand up befor the supreme court,millians of people depend on it
Today, Latinos make up the largest minority group in America’s schools, and they face challenges of monumental proportions. We’ve got to solve this problem, because if we allow these trends to continue, it won’t just be one community that falls behind—we will all fall behind together.	how about sendin the illegals back to their own country!  This means all illegals, not just the mexicans!  That would be a great start in helping!
The work of these students is a testament to the potential that awaits when we inspire young people to take part in the scientific enterprise: tackling tough problems and testing new hypotheses—to try, and then to fail, and then to try again until they succeed.	This is one of the most important lessons we as parents MUST teach our children if you fall get back up and try again and again and again and again..........
We can no longer afford to sit still. We need a smart system of infrastructure equal to the needs of the 21st century. And by making investments across the country, we won’t just make our economy run better over the long haul—we will create good middle-class jobs right now.	We need to spend money to make money, and this is what will bring our country into the future.

I hope America re builds all of their broken communities, like Katrina, and not leave them abandoned, which seems the case in terms of the last administration.

We’ve been through tough times before, and it is precisely in those times that we rebuilt, retooled, and recaptured the ingenuity and resilience that makes this nation so great. That’s how our predecessors built the first American century. That’s how we’ll build the next.	I think Obama's the best thing that happened to the US and the world in a long time
The President signs help for states to stay above water, preventing as many as 160,000 teacher layoffs and 900,000 public and private sector layoffs altogether.	Thank you!Now we need even more work on jobs and an overhaul of the failed HAMP program.Americans are hurting!
If we’re serious about making sure America’s workers—and America itself—succeed in the 21st century, the single most important step we can take is to make sure that every one of our young people has the best education that the world has to offer.	Education is the key to success in any society. Regardless of the cost, we need to invest wisely in our children, who are the future of our nation. 
Medicare isn’t just a program. It’s a commitment to America’s seniors—that after working your whole life, you’ve earned the security of quality health care you can afford.	Its about time the American people got health care without having to worry. Its a crime  that so many poor people can't even go to a doctor.
Organizing for America supporters across the country are standing with Elena Kagan—a Supreme Court nominee who embodies excellence, independence, integrity, and passion for the law.	How about passion for the Constitution? If Barack is supporting her most likely not..
We are going to rebuild this economy stronger than before, and at the heart of it are going to be three powerful words:  “Made in America.”	If Congolese people (DRC) had the same thinkings, it are going to be powerful words " Made in Congo".
Today, the American auto industry is growing stronger. It’s creating new jobs and manufacturing the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward an energy independent future.

As we celebrate the 45th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, we reflect on a moment when our nation made an enduring commitment to care for those who have given the most to our society and those living in poverty.	The mark of a great society is how well we take care of the least fortunate and the elderly.  Thank you for a great program!
We passed reform to put Americans in control of their own health care. Now, no matter your age or situation, there’s something for everyone at HealthCare.gov. Take a moment to check it out.	I think people who complain about this healthcare plan should not be allowed to use it or allow any of their family use it...
Equal access. Equal opportunity. The freedom to make our lives what we will. These aren’t principles that belong to any one group or any one political party. They are common principles. They are American principles.	"The freedom to make our lives what we will." If this is something Obama touts, why does he work so hard to deprive Americans of that right?

Wall Street reform will bring greater security to folks on Main Street, small businesses, community banks and credit unions who play by the rules, and shareholders and investors who want to see their company grow and thrive.	Anything, any action has to be better than letting Wall St run amok to ruin the economy of the world, as they did recently. 
We’re going to keep on fighting until wages and incomes are rising, businesses are hiring again, Americans are headed back to work again, and we’ve recovered from this recession.	Get rid of all the illegal workers, and unemployment will work itself out. Why are we paying benefits to those in our country illegally? 
Through the Affordable Care Act, more than 100 million will have access to new benefits that improve the coverage they already have.

We’re going make sure the jobs and industries of the future are taking root in America. That’s why we’re accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy and doubling our use of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.	all the power we need is free on the wind, with enough turbines along the shoreline, solar isn't nearly as efficient as wind power.
As we emerge from this recession, we cannot return to the pre-crisis status quo. We have to build a new and stronger foundation for growth and prosperity—and that’s exactly what we’ve been doing for the past 16 months.	as long as we save the earth.  we just have to work together to do it, right?
